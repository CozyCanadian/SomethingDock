Purpose: SomethingDock was made to make interactions between the driver and driver hub easier.

Notice: SomethingDock has not been tested during any competitions thus far and may not improve your driver’s success. SomethingDock: Logitech F310 is made for and tested on a Logitech F310 and probably doesn’t work with other controllers. 

Caution: While SomethingDock has been physically tested, it was done so with a 3D-printed version of the driver hub and not a REV-manufactured driver hub.
